          first-aid-skills and a talent in playing musical instruments. For hobbies I like playing 8-ball pool.

            <li>Developing websites and applications.
            </li>

        <h1>Background.</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am currently university student studying <span class="unimportant">Aeronautical Engineering</span> in my second academic year. I have done one presentation courtesy of Atlassian User Group on team effeciency and productivity. I took part in
          the facebook developers project along with other tech meet-ups such as Open Celluar Democratizing Access and learning how <span class="important">LTE baseband signals</span> work.
          <span class="cat-climate">This sparked up my zeal to join a programming school to learn and interact with other developers. </span>.
