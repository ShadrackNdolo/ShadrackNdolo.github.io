## Description
{This is a porfolio website of me and explains who I am is and what I do. The website showcases all the projects I have done during my first week in Moringa School. I have incorporated basic parts of front-end web development languages i.e. HTML and CSS. The website has three main sections mainly:

* A Home Section.
* A View Projects Section.
* An About Section.
}

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone or Download the repository on your command line terminal to view or edit the content. GitBash.exe for windows and Terminal for Linux.
* Click on the following website link to view the [site](https://shadrackndolo.github.io/).


{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}

## Known Bugs

*There are no known bugs. 

## Technologies Used

*HTML 5.
*BOOTSTRAP.
